# GMenu2x skin pack for RetroGame/RS-97

** Pimp your RS-97 with my latest skins for GMenu2x! **

This skin pack changes the appearance of GMenu2x that is included in the custom firmware for this device. Please update the skins included in the latest CFW with this new version as I keep adding icons for new emulators, games and applications.

### PS4
- icons and color theme of the current PS4 menu, clean and high-contrast
- contains settings, application and system icons
- 10 wallpapers, mostly blue and gray

### OldBoy
- Is the next-gen near-4k high-res screen of the RS-97 too sharp for your eyes, too?
- Never fear, I made a retro low-res skin to give you the familiar and eye pleasing look of a Game Boy :-)
- contains all icons for applications, emulators, games, settings and system (> 100)
- 5 wallpaper tints: green, grey, white, brown and blue
- variants of each wallpaper: aged, clean, backround images (26 total)

### Installation
- folders from zip file (PS4/OldBoy) must be copied to /mnt/game/gmenu2x/skins/
- via sd card: copy folders to your external sd card and use commander app to copy them to the skins folder
- via usb: copy folders to the rom partition and use commander app to copy them to the skins folder
- go to Settings > Skin, use left/right to select skin and confirm with start
- go to Settings > Wallpaper, find the wallpaper you like the most
